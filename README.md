## **Functional Requirements**
- Users can search for universities based on filters.
- Users can view application timelines and deadlines.
- Users can submit applications and attach necessary documents.
- Users can communicate with university representatives.
- Users can track the progress of their applications.

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**
- The app must be responsive and work across devices with varying screen sizes.
- The app must handle user data securely, adhering to privacy guidelines.
- The app should maintain a user-friendly interface with smooth navigation.

---

## **Test Plan**
A detailed test plan includes:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components like search functionality and data fetching.
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensuring that different modules (e.g., search and timeline) work together seamlessly.
3. **User Acceptance Testing**: Simulating user scenarios to validate app usability and functionality.
